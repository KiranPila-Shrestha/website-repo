		<p><b>Blog</b><br><br>2022,Technology<br><br><br><br>Technology is the simply the application of scientific knowledge which is simply develop and create for human development. Simply, It is the knowlege to the pratical aims of human life. It is also helps to manupulate the life of human into technolgy of life.Inorder word, Technology is the branch of knowledge that deals with applied science. Technology are used in all sector for different purpose such as in machine, industry and soon.Technology is also the developing result of accumulated knowledge and application in all method skills, processes used in industrial production and scientific research. The technology is worked on the different system. What is system?. System apply the specific application of a technology accumulated knowledge by obtaining specific input, altering input for the system through the process. Thus, then producing output an outcomes that alters the ultimate intended purpose of the system. <br> <br> The simplest and earliest form of technology is the simply development of knowledge which leads to the application for basic tools which further used for different purpose.Hence, Technology simply helps to create new application which further used for inventing new tools and solve different problems.<br>
		The technology has developed many things which has leads to development of the world. Some of them are: The invention of wheels is for the travelling technologies which helped humans to ttravel many place within short time. This indirectly or directly helps in increasing the production of theor busineess in different place. Hence, It reduce the problem of travelling. Similary many technologies has been developed to increase the business and industries of the people, Not only this the tools this has increased the knowledge and experience of people as a result they are being independent. Hence, This all helps in the development of world. The world has came to scientific world from stone age, Now it seems like this world may leads to robotic age . If like this technology is developed like this. Development in the use of the wheel had not only led to the development of the world but also there are many development such as telephone, internet, computer and soon. In the other words, This all technology helps to interact between the nation too.
		It has been long time that whole world is influenced by technology. Coming through stone age to the scientific age was long time.Now, the whole world is dependent upon the technology. Life without Technology is like hell to the people of todays world. There are so many advantages of technology. Some of them are explain in short below.<br><br> Technology uses much more scientific knowledge and values as much as facts, pratical craft knowledge as much as theoratical knowledge such as Ipod where the physics of making a small device which carry so much creative design to make an iconic must have accessory. As, technology includes organized ways of doing things such as interaction between products, machine, devices, people, system and soon which all include to make them, use them or are affected by them through various ways. <br><br> For Example, Many people like to drink coffee, often in coffee shop. That coffee may have came from tree which have been taken specially for increased yields that support a small farmer and his house but that required fertilizer that were developed in another nation. The harvested coffee beans will themselves be transported around the world to be placed in package which are distributed in the shop which is than used for making cuo of coffee ina cup which than was made for the purpose but which is then needed to disposed and so on. Hence, Every choice we make relies on, and feeds a highly interdependent and far reaching way of life where some have little and more. From this example we can know that technology can do proffession where people must have some skilled such as designing, engineering, managing, innovation, manufacturing, inventing, modelling, system thinking, developing and many more. Hence, Technology helps us to keep in touch with people who are far from us. We use computer, mobile phone, laptop etc to talk to them and even can see them. Likethis, this technology has so many advantages in our life.<br> Technology gives us various products which can be used for good or ill or where the advantages are disputed and similarly the processes involved in producing and using technology which means it may provides us and everyone else with a sustainable future.<br><br><br> In this 21st centurary, technology has affected almost most of every aspect of human like which include safety, food accessing, health services, socialization, productivity, and many more. This all technology have been made for progress and development of world. However, there are some disadvantages of this technology. Some of technology has been linked to a decline in mental health of people, increased social division and privacy concerns.Knowing the disadvantages of technology we can't escape from the truth that we all need technology in our day to day life.
		<br><br> Technology is the absolute need for us, we cannot escape from it.The importance of technology in our daily basis is undescriable.Through, the help of technology we have learn many things. Those technology which were only limited in well-developed nation, Now those technology have been used all over the world. This shows that technology has helped lot in development of world.This has made the life of people easy. </p>
